Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in nums[i+1:len(nums):1]:
                result.append(i)
                result.append(nums.index(target-nums[i],i+1))
                break
        return result
