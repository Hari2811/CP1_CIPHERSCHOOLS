Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
            int z=nums.length;
    for(int i=1;i<= k;i++)
    {
        int temp=nums[z-1];
        
        for(int j=z-1;j>0;j--)
        {
            nums[j]=nums[j-1];
        }
      nums[0]=temp;  
    }
    }
}
